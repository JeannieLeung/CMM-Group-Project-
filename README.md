## Overview
This project investigates how wind turbine **rotor diameter** affects **blade structural deflection**. The goal is to determine an optimal diameter that maximises power generation while keeping blade deflection within safe engineering limits.

---

## Project Objectives
- Model the relationship between rotor diameter and blade deflection.
- Predict deflection using analytical or numerical methods.
- Identify optimal diameters that balance efficiency and structural safety.
- Produce visualisations and documented findings.

## Background
Rotor diameter strongly influences energy capture, following the proportional trend:
